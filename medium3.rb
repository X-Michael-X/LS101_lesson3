# Question 1

# Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.

# It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

# In other words, in Ruby everything is an object...but it is not always THE SAME object.

# Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:

# For line 22 ; a_outer = 42 and a_outer_id = 85
# For line 23 ; b_outer = "forty two" and b_outer_id = 25276512 However it should be noted that each string creates a new object
# therefore if I assigned b_outer twice the object id would be different each time
# For line 24 ; c_outer = [42] and c_outer_id = 25144884 However just as above a reassignment of c_outer = [42] will 
# change c_outer's object_id
# For line 25 ; d_outer = c_outer[0] ( which is the integer 42 ) therefore d_outer_id is again 85

# For line 33 ; a_outer_id = 85 and a_outer_inner_id = 85 and lines 34 35 and 36 follow the same logic. a_outer_id and
# a_outer_inner_id are both pointing to the same object hence the id is the same.

# For lines 43 thru 46 using a-outer as an example the following would happen : first a_outer is reassigned ( in this case to 22 )
# however a _outer_id has not been changed and still points to the object_id for 42 , therefore a_outer_id would be 85 and 
# a_outer.object_id would be 45 ( because it is asking for the object_id  for the now reassigned a_outer.

# For lines 59 thru 62 using line 59 as an example a_inner = a_outer ( which is 22 ) and a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id ( which is 45 )
# so the string interpolations would be 22 / 45 / 45.However it should be noted that for b_inner and c_inner we are referring to 
# the ORIGINAL string and array as defined on lines 39 and 40.

# For lines 65 thru 68 even though we are outside the block our first variables ( i.e. a_outer ) have been reassigned. Therefore line 65
# would have these string interpolations 22/ 85 ( pre block object_id from when a_outer = 42 ) / 45 ( post block object_id ) and lines
# 66 67 and 68 would follow the same logic.

# For lines 70 thru 73 all lines are rescued because now that we are outside the block we have no access to a_inner ( therefore a_inner 
# is meaningless.



# Question 2

# Let's look at object id's again from the perspective of a method call instead of a block.

# Here we haven't changed ANY of the code outside or inside of the block/method. We simply took the contents

# For lines 123 thru 126 the logic is the same as lines 22 thru 25 in question 1.

# it should be noted that while the names of the variables are the same and they are pointing to the same objects ; the variables 
# themselves are new variables because they are within :an_illustrative_method.

# For lines 159 thru 162 we find the same logic used as in lines 43 thru 46 in Question 1.

# For lines 175 to 178 our logic is the same as lines 59 thru 62 in Question 1.

# For lines 131 thru 134 ( we are now outside of :an_illustrative_method and back inside :fun_with_ids ) we find the opposite happening 
# when we compare this code to lines 65 thru 68 in Question 1. In Question 1 lines 65 - 68 we find that the variables which were 
# reassigned in the block remain reassigned once we leave the block , but in Question 2 131 - 134 once we leave the method our 
# variables remain as they were defined on lines 113 thru 116. When :an_illustrative_method accepts a_outer as an argument , it is
# accepting the VALUE when have assigned to a_outer , not the VARIABLE a_outer.

# For lines 136 thru 139 we once againhave no access to a_inner etc. Therefore all lines require rescue. 

Question 3

Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as parameters and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.

Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
Solution 3
Question 4

To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the caller's version of it.

def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param << 'rutabaga'
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
Solution 4
Question 5

How could the unnecessary duplication in this method be removed?

def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end
Solution 5
